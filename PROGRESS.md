# DirectSponsor — Progress Notes
_Last updated: 2026-06-07 (session 10)_

## What's done and live

### Infrastructure
- PHP 8.4-fpm on RN1, Apache vhost for `directsponsor.net`
- **HTTP/2 enabled** (2026-04-03): swapped mpm_prefork → mpm_event + php8.4-fpm; `Protocols h2 http/1.1` in SSL vhost
- File-based storage under `/var/www/directsponsor.net/userdata/`
- Build system: `build.sh site` compiles includes, `deploy.sh --auto` rsyncs to RN1
- JWT auth shared with ROFLFaucet (`roflfaucet_session` in localStorage)
- Profile files named `{userId}-{username}.txt` under `userdata/profiles/`
- Nav: logo = home link; links are Fundraisers, Posts, About (all pages via `social-layout-start.incl`)
- Login links force `https://` in `redirect_uri` even when page visited over HTTP
- **Backups** (2026-04-03): `/root/backup-rn1-directsponsor.sh` runs every 6h → servarica1 + dr4; monitored by `verify-all-backups.sh` on ES3 with Telegram alerts

### Pages (all live on directsponsor.net)
- `index.html` — homepage
- `fundraisers.html` — lists all active fundraisers from `fundraiser-api.php?action=list`
- `fundraiser.html?project=ID&user=USERNAME` — individual fundraiser page with donate modal
- `posts.html` — blog/post feed; write box for logged-in users; single post view via `?user=X&post_id=Y`
- `profile.html` — own profile (edit mode) or public profile (`?user=USERNAME`, read-only)
- `edit-fundraiser.html` — recipient creates/edits fundraiser (no `?project=` = new, auto-assigned ID)
- `edit-fundraiser.html?project=ID` — edit existing fundraiser; redirects to fundraiser page on save
- `admin.html` — admin role management UI (search users, add/remove roles)
- `about.html`, `contact.html`

### APIs (all under `/api/`)
- `fundraiser-api.php` — `action=list` / `action=get&id=X&username=Y` / `action=user_projects&username=Y`
- `project-donations-api.php` — creates Coinos invoice; passes `donor_username` through to pending entry
- `webhook.php` — payment confirmation, updates `current-amount`, auto-advances queue; writes `donations_made` to donor's profile; logs to `transaction-ledger.json`
- `save-fundraiser.php` — saves fundraiser HTML comment-tags + writes `{id}-config.json`; falls back to profile's Coinos API key
- `simple-profile.php` — profile CRUD + role management; `action=my_donations` reads `donations_made` from profile file
- `auth-proxy.php` — proxies JWT validation to auth server
- `save-post.php` — saves posts as JSON to `userdata/posts/{username}/{timestamp}-{slug}.json`; JWT auth with body fallback
- `posts-api.php` — `action=feed` (all posts, paginated) / `action=post&username=X&post_id=Y` (full post) / `action=user_posts&username=X`
- `upload-project-image.php` — image upload; returns `image_url`

### Donation flow (fully tested with real payments)
1. Donor opens modal → name field auto-filled from JWT (editable); guests can type a name or leave blank
2. Picks amount → JS decodes JWT to get `donor_username` and reads name field → `project-donations-api.php` POSTs to Coinos API
3. Invoice + QR shown in modal, with Copy Invoice button
4. Webhook fires → `webhook.php` updates `current-amount` in project HTML, appends `<li>` to `<!-- recent_donations -->` block
5. If `current-amount >= target-amount`: file moved to `completed/`, next queued project becomes active
6. Overpayment shown on project page; no sats lost
7. `donor_username` written to `donations_made` in donor's profile file (for profile history)
8. `transaction-ledger.json` updated as audit trail
9. Poll loop detects payment → "Payment received!" → reload

### Project queue system
- Active project = lowest numbered HTML file in `username/active/`
- On goal reached: webhook auto-moves to `username/completed/`, next becomes active
- New project auto-numbering skips IDs used in both `active/` and `completed/`
- Overpayment stays as `current-amount` on next project (no carry-over math — just shown)

### Fundraiser page features
- Project image (direct URL from postimages.org etc), linked back to source with attribution
- Location and website link shown if set
- Full description used if available, short description as fallback
- Edit button shown to project owner
- Completed banner shown for non-active projects
- Overpayment shown when `current > goal`
- Recent donations list: donor name, amount, date (all donations kept, no cap)
- Donor name field in modal: optional, auto-filled for logged-in users, editable, blank = Anonymous

### Profile page features
- Recipient section: Coinos username, API key, lightning address (auto-populated from profile)
- My Projects section (recipients only): active + completed
- ⚡ Donations I've Made section (all logged-in users): reads from `donations_made` in profile file, links to project fundraiser page

### Recipient self-service
- Recipient can create/edit projects without admin involvement
- Role check: `recipient` role required (checked against profile file)
- Coinos API key stored in profile once; auto-populated in `edit-project.html`; `save-project.php` falls back to profile key

### Data architecture
- **Per-project HTML files** store all project data (title, description, amounts, donor list) in HTML comment tags
- **Per-user profile files** store profile fields + `donations_made` array (written by webhook on each confirmed payment)
- **`transaction-ledger.json`** is the audit trail; used for summaries/reconciliation, not for UI reads
- **No cross-site sync** — each site keeps its own profile data; only coins balance and JWT identity come from auth server

### RF Cutover
- `roflfaucet.com/fundraisers.html` → redirects to `directsponsor.net/projects.html`
- `roflfaucet.com/fundraiser.html` → redirects to `directsponsor.net/projects.html`

### Live fundraisers (as of 2026-04-03)
- `lightninglova/001.html` — Bitcoin4Ghana Internet Connectivity (active)
- `evans/001.html` — Badilisha Food Forest (active; Coinos API key confirmed working 2026-04-03)
- `andytest2/001-003.html` — completed test fundraisers
- `andytest2/004.html` — active test fundraiser (partially funded)
- Grant & Annegret (Desert Farm): on hold — Bitcoin not viable in Namibia. Project page archived to `archive/grant-annegret-project.html`. May revisit if a third-party runner is found.

## Payment provider notes

### Coinos outage — 2026-05-30
**Symptom:** donors see "payment service not available" after ~10s delay.
**Root cause confirmed from logs:** RN1 curl call to `https://coinos.io/api/invoice` times out with `0 bytes received` — TCP-level failure, not an API error. The Coinos website loads fine in a browser, which suggests the API endpoint (`coinos.io/api`) is on different infrastructure and is down or blocking RN1's IP.

**Affected:** `maibelris/001` — all attempts at 11:15, 11:16, 15:48, 15:53 UTC all timed out identically.

**Confirmed root cause (2026-05-30 ~17:15 UTC diagnostic):**
Cloudflare bot-challenge is blocking RN1 (`104.168.38.197`) from reaching the API.

- `curl -I https://coinos.io` → **HTTP 403** with `cf-mitigated: challenge` — Cloudflare is presenting a JS bot challenge that a headless server cannot pass
- `curl -v https://coinos.io/api/info` → TLS handshake completes fine, HTTP/2 request is sent, then **hangs for 10s with 0 bytes** — Cloudflare holds the connection waiting for a browser challenge response that never comes
- This is a server-side Cloudflare rule change on Coinos's end blocking API calls from non-browser user-agents/IPs

**Resolved ~19:00 UTC same day** — Coinos lifted the CF restriction without any report needed. Payments confirmed working (2 test payments made). Total downtime ~8 hours.

**Retained for reference in case it recurs** — if it does, use this message for Coinos support:
> Our server (IP 104.168.38.197) can no longer reach your API. TLS connects fine but all HTTP requests hang. `curl -I https://coinos.io` from our server returns HTTP 403 with `cf-mitigated: challenge`. It appears Cloudflare is now blocking non-browser requests, which breaks server-to-server API calls. Can you whitelist server IPs or add a Cloudflare rule to allow API traffic without browser challenge?

### Self-hosted Lightning node — assessment

**Previously tried and abandoned.** The blocker is not server cost but channel economics:

- To be reliably reachable on Lightning you need well-connected channels, which means either opening channels with a large, well-connected node (costly fee) or tying up significant bitcoin in channels yourself
- A node with poor connectivity means payments fail or route badly — worse UX than a custodial service
- This is a structural problem with Lightning today: being your own node and being well-connected are both expensive

**Long-term vision (noted for future):** each recipient project runs its own node — fully decentralised, no central custodian. This is the right direction but has two hard prerequisites:
1. Running a node must become extremely cheap (server + channel management)
2. Connectivity/routing must work without needing to pay for access to a large hub — i.e. Lightning (or a successor) reaches a state where everyone can be their own well-connected node at low cost

Until both conditions are met, custodial services (Coinos, Blink) are the pragmatic choice. The platform should be designed so switching to self-hosted nodes later is possible per-project without a central migration — each `{id}-config.json` already has a `type` field for this reason.

---

### Blink (blink.sv) — alternative Lightning wallet provider

**What it is:** Open-source custodial Lightning wallet originally built for Bitcoin Beach, El Salvador. Has a public API, works globally including Africa. Status page: https://blink.statuspage.io

**API overview (as of 2026-05):**
- GraphQL API at `https://api.blink.sv/graphql`
- Auth: `X-API-KEY: blink_...` header (API keys from dashboard.blink.sv)
- Create invoice: `lnInvoiceCreate` mutation → returns `paymentRequest` (bolt11) + `paymentHash`
- Webhooks: registered per-account (not per-invoice) via `callbackEndpointAdd` GraphQL mutation or Blink Dashboard; event type `receive.lightning`; uses Svix (exponential backoff retries)
- Webhook payload contains `walletId`, `paymentHash`, `settlementAmount`, `status`
- Registration: phone number required (unavailable in US and some other countries)
- Fees: free for intra-Blink; ~0.02% Lightning routing fees

**Advantages over Coinos:**
- Designed for developing-world use (El Salvador → Africa); anecdotally more stable
- Svix-backed webhooks with automatic retries (Coinos webhooks have no retry)
- Status page exists for monitoring
- Open source (Galoy stack) — can self-host eventually

**Disadvantages / differences requiring code changes:**
- GraphQL vs REST — bigger rewrite of `project-donations-api.php` and `webhook.php`
- Webhook is per-account, not per-invoice: can't embed a `secret` in the invoice. Webhook auth uses Svix-signed payloads (HMAC) instead
- Webhook identifies the recipient by `walletId` — need a lookup table: `walletId → username` (stored in each `{id}-config.json`)
- No `memo` field in webhook payload — matching to pending donation must be done by `paymentHash`
- Phone number required to sign up — potential barrier for some recipients

**Implementation plan when ready:**
1. Add `"type": "blink"` support to `{id}-config.json` (store `api_key` + `wallet_id`)
2. New invoice path in `project-donations-api.php`: GraphQL `lnInvoiceCreate`, same return shape
3. Update `webhook.php` to handle Blink's payload structure alongside existing Coinos format
4. Each recipient registers at dashboard.blink.sv, adds `https://directsponsor.net/webhook.php` as callback endpoint once

## Pending / next priorities

### Soon
- Grant & Annegret (Desert Farm): on hold — see above

### Future
- **Reconciliation script** (done — cron Sunday 3am on RN1, Telegram alert via DS_AuthBot to satoshihost-alerts group)
- **Nostr integration** — see `nostr-integration.md` for full plan; deeper integration (cross-node identity, flagging, fraud prevention) still pending
- **PHP error alerting** — use `set_error_handler()` + `error_log()` in the API files to catch unexpected errors, with a lightweight cron (or triggered script) that tails `/var/log/` and fires a Telegram alert via DSSitesCheckBot. No external dependencies; pure PHP + cron + existing bot.
- Auth server post-verification screen: update to show all 3 sites
- `delete-user.sh`: add clickforcharity.net cleanup step

### Sponsorship groups (Phase 1 live — 2026-05-03)

Phase 1 is deployed. Recipients can set up a group; sponsors can join the queue; recipient manages tier assignments.

**Live files:**
- `site/api/sponsorship-api.php` — actions: `list`, `get`, `join`, `leave`, `manage`, `setup`
- `site/sponsorships.html` — public listing of all groups
- `site/profile.html` — sponsorship sections added (public view with join button; recipient management; "Groups I'm Sponsoring")
- Data: `userdata/sponsorship-groups/{username}.json` — one file per recipient

**What's working:**
- Recipient (from profile page): creates/edits group description + suggested monthly sats; sees member list; promotes/demotes members between active/standby/queued tiers; removes members
- Sponsor (from sponsorships.html or recipient's profile page): joins queue; leaves group; sees their tier
- Public: sponsorships.html lists all groups with tier counts; recipient profile page shows group status + join button

**Phase 2 — Payments (live 2026-05-03):**

### Sponsorship payments — how it works

Payments are per calendar month. The system tracks `last_paid_month` (YYYY-MM) per member in the group JSON file. Duplicate payments for the same month are rejected by the API.

**Grace window (5-day rule):**
- Days 1–5 of the month: sponsor pays for the **current** month
- Day 6 onwards: sponsor pays for the **next** month
- Never more than one month ahead — prevents sponsors pre-loading funds against uncommitted income

**Data stored per member in group file:**
```json
"last_paid": "2026-05-03",
"last_paid_month": "2026-05"
```

**UI behaviour:**
- Not yet paid → `⚡ Pay for May 2026` button (large, on its own line)
- Already paid → `✓ Paid for May 2026` (greyed out, no button)
- Modal: QR code + invoice text + 📋 Copy Invoice button + status line
- On payment confirmed: modal stays open showing ✅ success message; sponsor closes manually; page reloads to show paid state

**API actions added to `sponsorship-api.php`:**
- `pay` (POST) — validates month format, checks grace window, checks duplicate, creates Coinos invoice, stores pending payment
- `check_payment` (GET) — polls pending payment status

**Webhook (`webhook.php`):**
- Detects sponsorship payments by `payment_type: sponsorship` in pending record
- Calls `processSponsorshipPayment()` — updates `last_paid` + `last_paid_month` in group file, writes to transaction ledger

**Infrastructure fixes made alongside payments (2026-05-03):**
- `save-fundraiser.php`: when a Coinos API key is saved to the project config, it is now also synced to the recipient's profile file — so sponsorship payments (which read from the profile) work automatically for any recipient who has set up a fundraiser
- `social-layout-start.incl`: nav profile link for logged-in user now goes to `profile.html` (no `?user=` param) instead of `profile.html?user=USERNAME` — the own-profile path triggers lazy auto-creation of the profile file; the public path (`?user=X`) does not
- `simple-profile.php`: `loadProfileData()` already auto-creates a minimal profile file on first own-profile GET (lazy-loads from auth server if possible, otherwise creates default)

**Phase 3 still to build:**

### Sponsorship groups — Phase 3 and beyond

- **Monthly payment flow**: ~~"Pay this month" button for active sponsors → Coinos invoice (same flow as fundraisers); payment recorded per-month per-sponsor in group file~~ ✅ done
- **Reminder + response-window system**: ~~monthly cron dispatches reminders by **email**; tracks who has responded; non-responsive actives demoted after window closes~~ ✅ done (2026-05-28). See `sponsorship-reminder-plan.md` for full design and decisions.
  - Grace window: **7 days** (days 1–7 pay current month; day 8+ pays next month)
  - Reminders: email on day 1, 4, 7 via auth server `send-notification.php` endpoint
  - Demotion: day 8 cron sets `slots=0`, emails sponsor + recipient, Telegram alert to admin
  - Amount: **server-enforced** — `slots × $10` converted to sats via CoinGecko price API; client-supplied amount ignored
  - Double payment: blocked server-side (payments history check)
  - ⚠️ TODO: switch BTC price source from CoinGecko to Coinos rate API (same call already in flight for invoice creation, avoids external dependency)
  - Slot model: **full or available** — no waitlist/queue; if slot opens, admin notified via Telegram, recipient finds replacement through own network
- **Automatic promotion logic**: not needed — slot model is full/available only; admin handles replacement manually when Telegram alert fires
- **Recipient group tools**: common fund accounting (income/outgoings, all members visible), coordinator action log, group decision documentation
- **Browser push / in-tab notifications**: Web Push API (service worker + VAPID keys) for payment arrival alerts to recipients. Decision: not needed for Phase 1 (no action required on join); revisit for Phase 2 when payments land. In-tab notifications (Notification API) are a simpler fallback if recipient has a tab open.
- **Network architecture**: DS is designed as independent nodes linked via Nostr — not a growing central platform. `directsponsor.net` is proof-of-concept. Deeper Nostr integration (cross-node identity, shared sponsor queues, flagging) is on the roadmap.

Design principles (structural, not rules):
- Max 12 sponsors per group
- Money never passes through an intermediary — payments go sponsor→recipient directly
- Common fund (if any) is collectively controlled — no single person has discretionary power
- Coordinator role is administrative only (carries out group decisions, no financial discretion)
- Reputational accountability: violating the DS definition loses network access, not legal sanction

### Comments — future optimisations (not urgent at current scale)
- **Cached comment count**: store `comment_count` in the post's own JSON file (updated by `comments.php` on write/delete) so the feed doesn't need to read the comments file per post — currently fine up to ~50 active posts
- **Comment pagination**: if a post accumulates >50 comments, paginate (API already has all data; add `?offset=` param and a "Load more" button in the UI)
- **How to Donate page** (done — `how-to-donate.html`): covers Lightning rationale, Coinos signup, faucets, Mt Pelerin. Still needs:
  - Video walkthrough (pending Adam confirming account deletion/recreation on Coinos)
  - Faucet details for litebits.io and satsman filled in
  - Recipient cash-out info (how lightninglova/evans convert sats to local currency)
- **Lightning explainer + donor onboarding page** — need a dedicated page (e.g. `how-to-donate.html` or similar) covering:
  - Why we use Bitcoin Lightning *only*: it's the only payment method that lets us see exactly when a specific payment arrives and credit it automatically, without the platform taking custody of funds
  - Why traditional banking doesn't work: fees are unreasonable for small international amounts, payments aren't direct (go through intermediaries), and there's no reliable way to match a payment to a specific fundraiser without building a full merchant system
  - How donors can get started easily:
    1. Open a free [Coinos](https://coinos.io) account (no KYC, instant)
    2. Fund it for free via faucets: **litebits.io** and **satsman** (small amounts but enough to test/start)
    3. Or buy sats with a bank transfer via **Mt Pelerin** exchange — no KYC for small amounts, straightforward bill-payment setup
  - A step-by-step tutorial (video or illustrated walkthrough) will need to be produced at some point covering the above flow end-to-end

### Comments system (live as of 2026-04-13)
- **Storage**: `userdata/comments/{username}-{post_id}.json` (keyed by post author + post ID)
- **API**: `site/api/comments.php` — GET to read, POST to write/delete; JWT required to post
- **One level of threading**: top-level comments (newest first) + replies (oldest first, collapsed by toggle)
- **Feed integration**: `posts-api.php` now returns `comment_count` per post (reads comments file); displayed as "💬 3 comments" or "💬 Comment" link on every feed card
- **Auth**: must be logged in to comment; guests see a login prompt
- **Delete**: users can delete their own comments (also removes replies)
- **Note**: `mbstring` PHP extension not installed on RN1 — use `strlen()` not `mb_strlen()` in all API files

### Posts / Blog system (live as of 2026-04-03)
- **Single content type** — everything is a "post"
- **Two display modes**: if `body` empty → full feed card; if `body` filled → intro+image preview with "Read more →"
- **Fields**: title, intro (required, 500 char soft limit), image_url, body (optional WYSIWYG HTML)
- **Editor**: inline on `posts.html` — progressive disclosure (short post by default, ✏️ Write an article expands WYSIWYG)
- **WYSIWYG toolbar**: Bold, Italic, H2, H3, Bullet list, Numbered list, Link (external links auto-get `target=_blank`)
- **Sticky toolbar**: `position: sticky; top: 3.2em` so toolbar follows user while writing long articles
- **Character counter**: intro field shows X/500, warns orange >400, red >500, hints to use article section
- **Image upload**: reuses `upload-project-image.php`, stored in `userdata/projects/{username}/images/`
- **Feed**: loads intro-only for performance; "Load more" pagination
- **Storage**: `userdata/posts/{username}/{timestamp}-{slug}.json`
- **JWT auth**: Authorization header with body fallback (Apache strips headers)

---

## Known gotchas / bug history
- **Profile glob was backwards** — profile files are `{id}-{username}.txt`; webhook glob must be `*-{username}.txt` not `{username}-*.txt`
- **`my_donations` API needs `user_id` param** — `getUserId()` reads GET/POST params, not Authorization header; `loadMyDonations()` in `profile.html` must pass `user_id` and `username` as query params
- **`recent_donations` block missing from older projects** — stub in `save-project.php` now includes it; existing files must be patched manually: `sed -i 's|</body>|<!-- recent_donations --><!-- end recent_donations -->\n</body>|' <file>`
- **`donor_name` defaulted to Anonymous** — now falls back to `donor_username` in `storePendingProjectDonation`; even cleaner via explicit name field in modal
- **lightninglova invoice failing with `user not provided`** — old ROFLFaucet-era project HTML had no comment tags; API key was also stale (6 months old). Fix: archive old file, recreate project stub on server, get fresh Coinos API key from lightninglova
- **RN1 SSH broken after single-key migration** — `IdentityFile` line was missing from RN1 entry in `~/.ssh/config`; fixed by adding `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Also needed to add `id_rsa.pub` to RN1's `authorized_keys` via web panel
- **CSS list styling** — global `ul { list-style: none }` was overriding bullets in WYSIWYG/post body. Fixed (2026-04-03): removed the global reset; content-page emoji lists use `class="plain-list"` instead; `.wysiwyg-body ul/ol` and `.post-body ul/ol` explicitly set `list-style: disc/decimal`. All post/wysiwyg styles now live in `directsponsor-compact.css`, no page-level `<style>` blocks.
- **Apache strips Authorization header** — JWT from `Authorization: Bearer ...` header is dropped by Apache. Workaround: send JWT in request body as `jwt` field; `save-post.php` and `save-fundraiser.php` both check body as fallback.
- **Profile `username` field blank on creation** (fixed 2026-06-07): profile files were created with the correct `{id}-{username}.txt` filename but `"username": ""` in the JSON. Cause: `site-utils.js` called `simple-profile.php?action=profile` without passing `username`, so `getUsername()` returned `""` and the new-profile path wrote a blank field. Fixed by (1) passing `username` in the profile fetch in `site-utils.js`, and (2) adding a backfill in `loadProfileData()` that patches and saves the file if `username` is blank but a hint is now available. Admin search (`searchProfiles`) matches on the JSON field, so users with blank usernames were invisible to search.
- **`.well-known/` excluded from deploy** (fixed 2026-06-07): `deploy.sh` rsync had `--exclude='.*'` which excluded the `.well-known/` directory. Fixed by adding `--include='.well-known/'` and `--include='.well-known/**'` before the exclude rule.
- **Ledger stored recipient as donor_username** (fixed 2026-04-08): `webhook.php` line 412 used `$donation['username']` (= recipient) instead of `$donation['donor_username']` (= actual donor) when writing the ledger entry. Fixed to `$donation['donor_username']`. Historical entries where donor==recipient in the ledger are flagged as "suspect" by the reconcile script — they are pre-fix test/self-donations lost to the glob bug, not a financial integrity issue.

### Session 10 — Nostr visibility + profile username fix (2026-06-07)
- **External relay broadcasting**: `save-post.php` now broadcasts every new post to `relay.damus.io`, `relay.primal.net`, and `nos.lol` in addition to the private relay. Added SSL support to `nostr_publish_ws()`.
- **Kind 0 metadata**: `save-post.php` publishes a kind 0 event (username + NIP-05 identity) on a user's first post. Controlled by `nostr_metadata_published` flag in profile file — fires once per user, then skipped. Covers both new and existing accounts (triggers on next post).
- **NIP-05 verification**: `site/.well-known/nostr.php` serves `username → pubkey` mappings for all DS users. Accessible at `https://directsponsor.net/.well-known/nostr.json` (Apache rewrite in SSL vhost). Deploy script updated to include `.well-known/` (was excluded by `--exclude='.*'`).
- **Profile username backfill**: `simple-profile.php` now backfills blank `username` in existing profile files when a hint is available. `site-utils.js` now passes `username` in the profile fetch so the hint reaches the server. Root cause: profile files were created with correct filename but blank JSON `username` field.
- **`avatar` → `picture` refactor**: renamed the profile field to match Nostr's field name; dropped the `uploaded:` prefix hack; plain URL stored directly. Auto-migration in `loadProfileData()` converts existing profiles on first load. Added a working profile picture upload UI to `profile.html` (circular preview, upload, remove). Picture now propagates to Nostr `picture` field in Kind 0 on every profile save.
- **Lightning address moved to all users**: previously recipient-only; now in Public Info section so any user can set it (for Nostr zaps via `lud16`).

### Nostr identity design note
- **NIP-05 handle** (`andy@directsponsor.net`) is a convenience label — server-dependent, breaks if the domain lapses, but is just a pointer
- **Keypair** (`nostr_privkey` / `nostr_pubkey`) is the actual identity — cryptographic, portable, server-independent. Users own it forever and can import it into any Nostr client
- This reinforces the decentralised node model: each DS node issues its own `username@node.tld` handles, but all users' Nostr identities are portable and interoperable across nodes

### Session 8 — Post notifications (2026-04-27)
- Created `@DSSitesCheckBot` (Telegram) — general-purpose site alerts bot
- Credentials stored in `/root/.telegram-sites-check` on RN1 (chmod 600)
- Built `/root/scripts/notify-new-posts.py` — scans `userdata/posts/*/*.json`, fires one Telegram message per user for posts newer than watermark; 10-min per-user cooldown
- State file: `/var/www/directsponsor.net/userdata/data/post-notify-state.json`
- Cron installed on RN1: `0 * * * *`, log: `/var/log/ds-post-notify.log`
- Disabled (de-scheduled) the broken `check_links.py` GitHub Actions workflow in `satoshihost/monitors` repo (CFC PTC page JS renderer failing; manual trigger still available)

### Session 6 — Reconciliation (2026-04-08)
- Built `scripts/reconcile.py` (deployed to `/root/scripts/reconcile.py` on RN1)
- Three checks: (1) ledger entries missing from donor profiles, (2) profile `donations_made` missing from ledger, (3) project HTML `current-amount` vs ledger sum
- Found and fixed the `donor_username` ledger bug above
- Reconciliation result: **0 genuine discrepancies**. 17 historical suspect entries (pre-fix test payments, all explainable). 1 HTML amount mismatch on `andytest2/004` (+100 sats, test data, not a concern).
